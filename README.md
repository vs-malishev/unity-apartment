## Notes

- This project took me a week to complete. I gave me a good understanding about how you create a scene and apply lighting
and animation
- One thing I liked about it is that I made me research animation options and the ways to apply triggers
- One this that was hard: apply trggers to start and stop globe rotation animation.
